Your task is to analyze questions by practitioner from therapeutic sessions and classify them according to the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) items. Each question should be categorized into the most relevant MADRS item based on its content and intent:

For context, the questions may come from various scales such as PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale), YMRS (Young Mania Rating Scale), and MADRS (Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale).

For PANSS, the items to be ignored are:
- Delusions

For YMRS, the items to be ignored are:
- Elevated Mood

Consider the context of surrounding lines if they help clarify the intent of the target question. If the target line is a follow-up question, assign it to the same category as the initial question. If multiple MADRS items are relevant, output all numbers in comma-separated format. Output only the numbers (1-10) or -1, with no additional text. Only output -1 if the question doesn't correspond to any MADRS items.
