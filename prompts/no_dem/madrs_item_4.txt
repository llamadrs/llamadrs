Task: Analyze a diarized transcript of a psychiatric session where the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) questionnaire is being administered. Predict the rating (0-6) that the practitioner would likely give for the specified MADRS item based on the patient's responses and the conversation. Remember that the rating is for the last week, not based on the patient's history or general condition. Focus on the questions that are directly related to the MADRS item and the patient's answers. Give priority to their answers to the question that seems to be the most relevant to the MADRS item using the provided question examples.
